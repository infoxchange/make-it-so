/**
 * The AWS DNS Adapter is used to create DNS records to manage domains hosted on
 * [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/).
 *
 * This adapter is passed in as `domain.dns` when setting a custom domain.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "example.com",
 *     dns: sst.aws.dns()
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also specify a hosted zone ID if you have multiple hosted zones with the same domain.
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "example.com",
 *     dns: sst.aws.dns({
 *       zone: "Z2FDTNDATAQYW2"
 *     })
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
